# Kailh Choc Switches

The following instructions are for Choc switches. You need to do all steps on both the left and right boards. You can also use the optional EC11 encoders and OLED display with Choc switches, but I choose to leave them both off for this build.

When using Choc switches it looks better if you lower the acrylic cover, to do this donâ€™t use the IC sockets (steps 13 and 22 in the main instructions) and solder the ATMega328P and MCP23017 directly to the PCB.

The mechanical assembly will follow this diagram:

**Step 1**

Place the pcb plate on the main pcb, and insert a few Choc switches. Make sure everything fits correctly. Then add the remaining switches.

**Step 2**

Check that the switches are all inserted correctly, then solder the switches.

**Step 3**

Attach the 5mm standoffs or the acrylic cover using 3mm screws. If you used IC sockets, use 8mm standoffs.

**Step 4**

Attach the acrylic covers using 5mm screws, and fit the keycaps.
