# MX Switches with Kailh sockets

The following instructions are for MX Switches with Kailh sockets. You need to do all steps on both the left and right boards.

The mechanical assembly will follow this diagram:

**Step 1**

**42-44 x Kailh Sockets**

Solder the Kailh Sockets on the reverse of the board. Do not add a socket where you will be using the optional EC11 encoders (for example sw22 in the diagram below).

**Step 2**

**2 x EC11 encoder (optional)**

You can optionally use EC11 encoders, in one of three positions marked on the board with the square. To fit the encoder you must first clip the two larger mounting pins on the sides of the encoder (adding the fixing holes on the pcb would have interfered with the key switch positions).

Solder one of the encoder legs and then check that the encoder is mounted squarely. Solder the remaining encoder legs to the pcb.

Apply a small piece of electrical tape to the encoder, this will prevent the encoder legs shorting on the pcb plate.

**Step 3**

The metal plating on some of the holes in the pcb plate is not perfect, so check the fit of the switches before the next step. I have found that occasionally Gazzew Boba U4 switches would stick in some of the thumb positions, and this might happen with other types of switches too. If you find a switch is sticking, use a small metal file to smooth the inside edges of the plate.

**Step 4**

Attach the 3+3mm standoffs with 3mm screws in the mounting holes of the pcb plate, and then put the plate on the main pcb.

**Step 5**

Insert the switches through the pcb plate into the Kailh sockets. Keep the main pcb on a flat surface while installing the switches so that the sockets are supported.

**Step 6**

Secure the plate using 3mm standoffs.

**Step 7**

Attach the 8mm and 3+3mm standoffs for the acrylic cover.

**Step 8**

Use 3mm screws to attach the base. Attach the feet where shown.

**Step 9**

Attach the acrylic covers using 5mm screws.

**Step 10**

Finally add the keycaps and knobs. You're finished!
