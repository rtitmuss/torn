Torn
===============

![torn](./doc/img/torn.jpg)

The split keyboard kit made by through hole components only. The design has been inspired by the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid) and [Discipline](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) keyboards.

Torn uses an Atmega328P cpu, running QMK with VUSB:
- [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/torn/readme.md).
- [Bootloader](https://github.com/rtitmuss/USBaspLoader).
- Compatible with [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/)

### Building your own Torn keyboard

Later this year you will be able to buy a Torn keyboard kit from [splitkb.com](https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/january-2021).
Alternatively you can also buy [all the parts](./doc/bom.md) needed youself.

Instructions are in the [Build guide](./doc/build.md) and [Troubleshooting guide](./doc/troubleshoot.md).

You can ask questions and get help on the [Torn Discord channel](https://discord.gg/mamAqNccju).

### Thanks

It would not have been possible for me to design Torn without the information and designs published by the mechanical keyboard community. So thanks go to ...
